<h1>Quantum Networking Workshop: Modeling, Applications, Design</h1>

**Location:** LGRC

**Time:** June 2nd and June 3rd

A two-day workshop on the many layers of the quantum networking technology stack, chiefly aiming to shape the next year of collaboration between UMass, Yale, Argonne National Laboratory, and colleagues within the Center for Quantum Networks.

This will also be the first gathering of external advisors for the [QuantumSavory](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumSavory.jl/) modeling toolkit.
