### [August 2024: Summer School on Numerical Methods in Quantum Information Science](https://qnumerics.org)

A summer school on Numerical Methods in Quantum Information Science, taking place in Boston (August 12th-18th).

The school covers best practices in software engineering, as well as the fundamentals of high-performance modeling techniques including state vector master equations, tensor networks, and the stabilizer formalism and its generalizations -- crucial tools in modeling quantum hardware and error correction. Multiple hackathons will be executed where instructors will be able to help you with your own research projects. The Unitary Fund will run a workshop on near term error mitigation techniques during the school.

We will keep this year's class quite small: only 30 people, to ensure higher quality interactions between students and instructors.

The school is aimed at graduate and professional level researchers in QIS, however we have a few spots reserved for particularly talented undergraduates (registration and travel grants will be available to undergraduates).

Organized by Stefan Krastanov.

### [April 2024: Quantum Information Science and Technology Workshop](../2024-qist-workshop)


The QIST workshop is designed to bring together a diverse group of researchers working on various aspects of quantum information spanning across computation, communication, precision measurements, and sensing applications.  

Organized by Rajveer Nehra.

### January 2024: UMass/Yale Workshop on Quantum Networks

A day-long workshop on research in the many layers of the quantum networking technology stack.

Organized by Don Towsley and Stefan Krastanov.
